BigBacter is a pipeline aimed at simplifying bacterial genomic surviellance.
This is accomplished by:
1) pre-clustering isolates into closely related subtypes prior to phylogenetic analysis
2) automatically selecting and archiving subtype-specific reference genomes for SNP analysis
3) identifying and excluding low quality samples
4) archiving samples and automatically including them when samples of the same subtype are identified
5) re-using archived alignment files, thus greatly increasing the speed of SNP analysis
6) automatically generating figures needed for phylogenetic analysis (i.e., trees and SNP matricies)

BigBacter was originally written by Jared Johnson for the Washington State Department of Health.
